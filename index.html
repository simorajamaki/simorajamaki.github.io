    <p>Hi! Welcome to my website. My name is Simo and I like making stuff.
       I like to think of myself as a creative person who has maybe a bit too many interests. 
       Aside from web development, I make music, develop video games, edit photos/videos, do 3D modelling and I'm always looking to learn more.
      The goal of this website is to showcase some of the things I have worked on and share my thoughts to anyone who stumbles across it.
